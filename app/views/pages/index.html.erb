      <h3 class="h4"><i class="icon-lightbulb"></i> What's the idea?</h3>
      <p class="">
        Artists today are able to record and distribute their work freely, globally and without unecessary interference - I'd like live performance to be that way too.</p>
       <p>100 Motels comprises <strong>risk-free Web Ticketing and Crowdfunding</strong> in one, the foundation I hope for a service that will
        achieve that goal.

      <h3 class="h4"><i class="icon-money"></i> Low fees</h3>
      <p class="">
        If you're an Artist performing CC licensed work 100 Motel's fee is discounted to only 1% of the ticket price, othewise it's 2.5%.</p>
        <p>Credit card processing is handled by Stripe who currently charge 2.9% plus 30c per transaction.</p>

      <p class="">
        How about free refunds? Not magical perhaps but pretty cool all the same.</p>
        If you need to cancel your event at the last moment and refund your customers they won't be out of pocket, Stripe and 100 Motels fees will be refunded along with the ticket-price.</p>
        <p> When I said risk-free I really meant it!

        100 Motels allows you to test and alter your events without any financial consequences for you or your customers. You can change the date, discount the ticket price or do whatever it takes to make your event viable.

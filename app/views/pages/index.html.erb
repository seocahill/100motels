      <p class="">
        Web-age Performing Artists have never had is so good in terms of inpiration, instruction, creation and distribution. But we haven't as yet figured out how to replicate the performing opportunites that are afforded to commerically backed acts. As an artist myself I really want that to change.</p>
       <p>100 Motels comprises <strong>risk-free Web Ticketing and Crowdfunding</strong> in one, the foundation I hope for a service that will
        achieve that goal.

      <h3 class="h4"><i class="icon-money"></i> Low fees</h3>
      <p class="">
        <p>First off you can take as many orders as you like <strong>without incurring fees</strong> - that only happens when you draw funds into your bank account.</p>
        If you're an Artist performing CC licensed work 100 Motel's fee is discounted to only 1% of the ticket price, othewise it's 2.5%.</p>
        <p>Credit card processing is handled by Stripe who currently charge 2.9% plus 30c per transaction.</p>

      <p class="">
        How about free refunds? Not magical perhaps but pretty cool all the same. When I said risk-free I really meant it!
      </p>
      <p>Other stuff I'm currently working on include the ability to split, copy and reschedule events so that customer orders aren't wasted if a event doesn't go ahead as orginally planned, and also a cross-platform mobile app with some native features like barcode scanning.</p>

      <h3 class="h4"><i class="icon-beaker"></i> Experiment with your Events</h3>
      <p class="">
        One of the main ideas behind 100 Motels is to ecourage Artists and Organizers, to try risky or uncertain event opportunities where previously t
        failure may have discounted out of hand.</p>

        <p>To that end, 100 Motels allows you to test and alter your events without any financial consequences for you or your customers. You can change the date, discount the ticket price, run events against each other or do whatever it takes to hit funding or attendence targets.</p>

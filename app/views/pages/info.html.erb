          <h3><span class="muted">Hi, I'm Seosamh and I developed 100 Motels.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">My experience in music has inspired me to try and change some things, and this is my first cut at it. The focus of 100 Motels is live musical performance, specifically touring. If you're curious about my background, my thoughts on music, web development or anything else check out <a href="//seocahill.com">my blog</a>.  </p>

          <p class="lead"><strong>PR, lobbying or industry experience is irrelevant on 100 Motels.</strong> Music decides, there is no other consideration. So make recordings you like, get them out into the commons and then practice your performance. </p>
          <p class="lead">After you sign up add a music or video playlist to your profile. Look through local events for a support slot, or organizer profiles if you're looking to tour a particular location. To register your interest just click the request button on the event/organizer profile page. The organizer will receive a private message with your media and contact email. You can track and cancel all requests in your user account. </p>
          <p class="lead">If you receive an offer to tour from an Organizer you need to agree a sales target to cover your costs, once that's done you can expect the Organizer to handle everything else. </p>

              <strong>Financial overhead is a worry for anyone organizing a show.</strong> When a sale occurs on 100 Motels the credit card information goes straight to our payment provider, <a href="//stripe.com">Stripe Inc.</a>, who return us a token which is encrypted and stored with the order information. Later on the token can be used to charge the customer for their order. Raising money this way has a number of advantages:
            </p>
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>More secure; our servers never handle any sensitive financial information, Stripe handle all PCI compliance.</li><br>
              <li>Better for the user; credit card information need be entered only for the first purchase, the amount to be paid is not ringfenced or 'captured' while the order is pending and orders can be cancelled up and until the organizer decides to go ahead with the event.</li><br>
              <li>Funding without risk. As the organizer of an event you can make actual sales without incurring bank charges. You can discount tickets, reschedule or do whatever it takes to make your event viable before finally drawing down the sales monies.   </li><br>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead"> The provision of a risk free funding environment is vital for any speculative enterprise to succeed, organizers <em>and</em> their customers have that with 100 Motels.</p>

              <strong>Artists in general, have to do way too much.</strong> Especially leading up to a big show this can have a major impact on the performance. So I designed 100 Motels to have as minimal a requirement for Artist participation as possible. Show requests are like that, there are three basic steps:
            </p>
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Sign up for a normal user account and then add Artist media in your User Account Settings</li><br>
              <li>You will see a 'Request Support' button at the top of every Event page, click it and the Organizer of that event will recieve your request to play as a support act for that event along with your supplied media and contact details.</li><br>
              <li>Likewise if you are browsing Organizer profiles you will see "Request Tour" instead. Again the Organizer will receive your media and contact details. </li><br>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead"> Should your request be successful you will be contacted by the Organizer, you can follow the status of you requests by checking your user account.</p>

        <div class="featurette" id="organizer">
          <div class="page-header"><h1 class="featurette-heading">The Organizer. <span class="muted">Put your musical opinions on Stage.</span></h1></div>
          <p class="lead">If you already spend a lot of time picking music for the benefit of other people, why not organize a show? I built 100 Motels so that anyone who wanted to do so, would have the tools to fund and organize the live performance of a Touring Artist.
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>You're free to pick your own touring Artists and local support or to choose from your private request messages.</li><br>
              <li>You get mobile ticketing and risk-free crowd-funding for you event.</li><br>
              <li>All sales monies are deposited directly into your account, 7 days after you decide to draw down payment.</li><br>
              <li>How much profit you take is between you and the Artist but bear in mind  <strong> that the Artist must never pay to play.</strong></li><br>
            </ul>

          <p class="lead">Buying tickets on 100 Motels is a pain-free experience. </p>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>There are no ads, promotions or hidden charges.</li><br>
             <li><strong>We never see your payment information</strong>, all credit card processing is handled directly by our payments provider, Stripe.</li><br>
             <li>You can save a user account at any time when making a purchase but it's not necessary. If you choose to create an account you can purchase tickets with a saved credit card (one mouse-click) and also track and cancel existing orders.</li><br>
             <li>You don't have to print anything, the barcoded email receipt on your phone is your ticket. </li><br>
             <li>If the event is cancelled for some reason, you get a refund of the full ticket price.</li><br>
           </ul>

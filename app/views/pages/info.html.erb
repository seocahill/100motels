            <strong>100 Motels is a 'Stripe App'</strong> meaning there is only a full service in the countries Stripe service, currently the US and Canada.
          </p>
          <p> You can run events and charge credit cards in any country but in order to receive money you need a USD or CAD bank account.</p>
          <p>
            The good news is Stripe recently started a UK beta with Europe to follow.

<%=  @organizer.your_account_or_email %> we processed <%= pluralize(@orders.count, 'transaction') %> in total

Dated: <%= @orders.last.updated_at %>

Need to fix this to only show orders that were processed

<%= @orders.select {|o| o.stripe_event == :paid }.count %> paid
<%= @orders.select {|o| o.stripe_event == :refunded }.count %> refunded
<%= @orders.select {|o| o.stripe_event == :failed }.count %> failed
<%= @orders.select {|o| o.stripe_event == :cancelled }.count %> cancelled

We notifiy each customer by email when a card is declined.

You can view view all failed charges in your admin area.

thanks,

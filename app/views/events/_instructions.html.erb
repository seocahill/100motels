<p>You can edit this page by clicking on any element that is marked with an <i class="icon-edit"></i> icon. All your changes should be saved automatically. </p>
<p>If you want to keep and/or publish this event you need to save your account which is a guest account at the moment. Click on the menu item in the top right corner.</p>
<p>I've laid out the page to cover the basics of what you might need to advertise your event. This section is for text only (no html, embeds), you've got video, soundcloud and location embed sections ajacent. </p>
<p> If you prefer you can edit the event details in a form, from the 'event settings' submenu.</p>
<p> You can change the background image via the submenu also.</p>
<p> Last point is 100 motels is very much beta, so this is a work-in-progress, I welcome suggestion to improve - thanks!</p>
